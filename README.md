# TGG Workarounds

The repository consists of list of problems appearing when dealing with TGG engines (specifically eMoflon). The problems are provided with workarounds to overcome them. 
Each folder in the repository represents a project for one specific problem. This way we can maintain complexity and concentrate only on one problem at a hand. 
To contribute or to benefit from the repository simply clone it to your PC and import projects from one of the folders. 

## Requirements
- Eclipse Luna with installed eMoflon beta plugin  
- Enterprise Architect 12 with installed eMoflon beta extension
